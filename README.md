## Comfort Place

This is my final project.It's more difficult than my previous projects. 
 
### What was used?
I used urllib.parse for parsing youtube videos's urls and pagination. I learned a lot about parsing and tried to do my 
best in this area. The pagination is important part of my project too. 

### Details
Also I worked on design and chose pink color as a main color. I used cute symbols to do it look more aesthetic. 

### Admin stories
As an admin I want to videos opening exactly on my page instead of youtube. Also as an admin I want no hate on this page
from people, only support.

### Why?
#### the idea

The main idea of this project is help for artists. Now you can see only start. I want this project to be a 
"Comfort Place" for artists. They could find here psychology help, recommendations for materials, support, and other 
helpful things. As an artist too I know how hard that could be to stay calm and alive when you have no support or 
appreciation for your creations. Usually artists are more emotional and vulnerable so they need more caring attitude. 
That's the reason and the idea of my project. I'm planning to explore it in the future. 

I really hope that it'll be interesting for someone and with this project I may help them.â™¡
